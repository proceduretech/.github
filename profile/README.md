## Welcome to our playbook

It gives me immense pleasure to give you a tour of our company. We have built this company with love and care keeping the long game in mind. Our ethos and decision also reflect this approach.

Our team is a mixed bag. Of the smart and the hard-workers. Of the organised and slightly chaotic. Of the early risers and the burners of the midnight oil. We appreciate diversity and truly like having differing perspectives in the room.

We pride ourselves on being early adopters of the latest tools, libraries and frameworks while delivering business value all the time. People who work with us fall in love with their craft. We have changed the definition of "work" for them.

**Here are some of our beliefs around work**

1. **Work is only 1 part of your life** and not your entire life. We treat it as such.
2. **Weekends are sacred** and not to be messed around with. You won't be asked to work on one.
3. **Commuting is a waste of time**. Working from home saves you additional time. Go crazy with it.
4. **Side gigs are welcome**. We believe there are multiple avenues to learn and grow. Why restrict it to only work?
5. **Asynchronous by-default**. Synchronous communication is expensive, so we default to writing docs and literature to enable async communication.
6. **Good things come in pairs.** Errors get halved. Productivity, ideas and fun get doubled. Learning gets accelerated exponentially.
7. **Learning from mistakes.** If you are not making mistakes and learning from them, you are not growing.

Apart from work, we continually invest in growing you as a professional and a human.

- **Extensive Boot Camp** - get to learn, regardless of your experience, about Data Structure and Algorithms, LLD, HLD, DevOps, frontend, backend and/or test engineering.
- **Book club** - broaden your horizons by picking up a book every month and have fun doing so
- **P1, The Half Yearly Tech Conference** - here's where we explore futuristic themes to keep you informed about what's happening in the tech space outside our office.
- **Internal Projects** - where your craft, experiment and learning takes precedence over deadlines. Also, try out new technologies and domains.

**Growth requires mentorship**

We believe choosing a mentor is more important than choosing a company. My co-founder, [Braj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brajkishorb/), and I have more than a decade of experience in our respective fields. I will be mentoring you to become a better engineer and a coder. Braj will help you with domain expertise, product thinking and problem-solving. Ask us how it has helped our ex-employees in their careers when you chat with us.

**What's it like here**

We love debating over languages and frameworks and want someone who can bring their opinions to these discussions. We love reading/sharing articles, podcasts, tech essays. If you are someone who loves tea or coffee, Marvel or DC, Peterson or Zizek, or even something eclectic, you will feel right at home. Continuous improvement is at the heart of everything we do at work & outside.
